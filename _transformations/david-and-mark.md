David and Mark are 2 of our most dedicated members, starting just over 12 weeks ago they wanted to lose some weight and get a bit fitter.

David loosing 3 stone and mark loosing 1 stone, unreal progress so far from the lads.

- bodyfat down.
<br>- fitness up.
<br>- strength through the roof.
<br>- more energy etc, list goes on.

No magic pill, no quick fix, no extreme diet.
<br>Just hard work and persistence, making a few simple changes to their diet, no banning of food groups.

The 2 lads train with another mate johnny who joined purely for fitness and strength..... and has made unreal progress too.

The lads train once in a small group setting and do two conditioning classes each week.

Amazing work from the 3, never an excuse, giving everything 100% and being great craic throughout, pleasure having them in Primal.
