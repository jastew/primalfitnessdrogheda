description: "Can't recommend primal fitness enough.The two lads are brilliant. There is a great positive feel to the gym and it that's down to Ben and Stephen. I have just finished a 12 week program and its the best training I have ever done. I have to thank Ben for all the help and pushing me every day,Ben is a real gentleman and a great motivator, Theres not much this man doesn't know about changing your body !! If anyone is thinking of signing up, you won't regret it, money well spent!!! Am over the moon with my results ! I will definitely be signing up again"
