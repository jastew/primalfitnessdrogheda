![](/uploads/versions/progress---x----750-465x---.jpg)2-3 weeks into your new gym, class, running group, whatever it is…. looking at yourself in the mirror, you might not see the results you want….. don't throw in the towel.

Right from the start take pictures of your body, same angles, same distance away from the camera, maybe even same clothes.

If you're training and nutrition has been good for 80-90% of the time, you most definitely will see progress in 3 weeks.

It's optional here in Primal, but we strongly advise it….. if you don't let us take them then you must take them at home.

It will keep you super motivated seeing progress, and you can look back at how far you've come (also very important).

\*scales are NOT good for progress in the majority of people. (Another post on this)
