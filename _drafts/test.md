CREATE HABITS!

If your New Years resolution is to get in shape. Here's what I recommend, break down your goals into mini goals or habits.

Myself personally, one of my goals is to get more veg into my diet, I'm not too bad at eating veg but I could be a whole lot better.

So..... (new habit) I decided every day il get a green smoothie in before or with my breakfast. There's nothing magic about a smoothie.&nbsp;
<br>A simple, water, ice, scoop of protein(optional)&nbsp;
<br>as much spinach or frozen brocolli as possible.

Any veg will do but I'm going to keep it green everyday. Apart from all the goodness of the veg, this habit alone I know will keep me focused (diet wise) for the rest of the day.

Give it a go, you'll feel awesome!
